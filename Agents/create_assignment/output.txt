**Assignment Title: Analyzing Natural Language Processing Techniques**

**Objective:**
The objective of this assignment is to understand the different methodologies used in Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly focusing on structured representations of text and their implications in answering queries.
**Instructions:**
1. Read the provided excerpts on Natural Language Processing techniques carefully.
2. Answer the following questions based on your understanding of the content.

**Questions:**

1. **Structured Representation:**
   a. What is the significance of converting questions into structured forms in NLP?
   b. Briefly explain the slot and filler system mentioned in the content. How does it improve the effectiveness of NLP systems?

2. **Comparative Analysis:**
   a. Compare the effectiveness of Method 2 in generating answers to questions versus traditional methods described. What are the key advantages noted?
   b. Discuss the importance of a structured form in recognizing and returning the requested segments of questions.

3. **Practical Application:**
   a. Given the sentence, “She found a red coat she really liked,” identify the components (agent, object, modifier) and represent them in a structured manner as illustrated in the text.
   b. Create a simple example of your own using a sentence and convert it into its structured representation similar to what is shown.

4. **Reflection:**
   a. Reflect on the challenges one might face when implementing structured representations in real-world NLP applications. What could be potential solutions?     
   b. Discuss how understanding these concepts can benefit your own programming or development projects in the future.
